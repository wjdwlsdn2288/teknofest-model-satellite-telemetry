Welcome to the **Teknofest Model Satellite Telemetry** repository! This project serves as a backend system built on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W for the Teknofest 2024 Model Satellite Competition. Our goal is to provide real-time telemetry and live camera streaming, utilizing various sensors and technologies.

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-Time Telemetry**: Collect and visualize data from sensors like BMP390, TMP117, and BNO055.
- **Live Camera Streaming**: Stream video feeds directly from your Raspberry Pi.
- **WebSocket Servers**: Enable real-time communication between the server and clients.
- **Flask Dashboard**: An intuitive web interface built with Flask and styled using Tailwind CSS.
- **Servo Control**: Manage parallax servos for mission-critical tasks.
  
## 📦 Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/wjdwlsdn2288/teknofest-model-satellite-telemetry/releases). This will provide you with the necessary files to set up the system on your Raspberry Pi.

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
- Raspbian OS installed
- Basic knowledge of Python and Flask
- Access to the internet for updates and packages

### 📥 Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wjdwlsdn2288/teknofest-model-satellite-telemetry.git
   cd teknofest-model-satellite-telemetry
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   Ensure you have Python 3 and pip installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Sensors**: 
   Connect the BMP390, TMP117, BNO055, and RP2040 to your Raspberry Pi according to the wiring diagram in the documentation.

4. **Run the Application**: 
   Start the Flask server with:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the Dashboard**: 
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://<your_pi_ip>:5000` to view the dashboard.

### 📡 WebSocket Communication

The WebSocket servers allow real-time data exchange. Clients can connect to the server to receive live updates on telemetry data. 

### 📸 Live Camera Streaming

To enable live camera streaming, make sure your camera module is properly connected. You can access the video stream at `http://<your_pi_ip>:5000/camera`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W**: The main hardware platform for this project.
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework for Python.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the dashboard.
- **WebSocket**: For real-time communication.
- **BMP390, TMP117, BNO055**: Sensors for environmental and orientation data.
- **RP2040**: A microcontroller for handling servo control.
